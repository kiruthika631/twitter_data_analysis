Analyzing the data can provide valuable 
insights into user behavior, preferences, and trends. However, traditional 
data processing techniques often struggle to handle the scale and 
complexity of such datasets. This is where big data technologies like 
Hadoop come into play. This study focuses on leveraging Hadoop for 
analyzing Twitter data. The Hadoop ecosystem provides powerful tools like 
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for storing large datasets and Hive 
for SQOOP for data quering. By employing these tools, we can efficiently 
process and analyze Twitter data to extract meaningful insights. The analysis 
covers various aspects such as user demographics, content preferences, 
engagement metrics, and sentiment analysis. Data visualization using 
Python, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations within the data that can 
inform strategic decisions for businesses, marketers, and policymakers. 
Additionally we have also analysis the twitter data using R Language for 
proper Data Visuvalization.
